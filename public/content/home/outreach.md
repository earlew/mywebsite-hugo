In 2016, I participated in the 6-week long I08S GO SHIP cruise. While at sea, I maintained a regular [blog](http://floatdispenser.blogspot.com/2016/03/a-day-in-life-of-ctd-watch-part-33.html) and took questions from a class of six graders at Lakeside Middle School in Seattle.

I am also a volunteer at the [Pacific Science Center](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/planetarium/) in Seattle, where have given planetarium presentations on doing observational oceanography in the Southern Ocean.
