During the austral winters of 2016 and 2017, large openings in the sea ice occurred in the Weddell Sea, near the Maud Rise sea mount. These openings, otherwise known as polynyas, were the largest to have appeared in the Southern Ocean since the late 1970s. More importantly, these polynyas occurred near two under-ice Argo floats. This coincidence granted us an unprecedented view of the upper ocean evolution during these polynya events.

By combining the float measurements with concurrent atmospheric reanalysis and remotely-sensed sea ice observations, we were able to pinpoint the preconditions and triggers that led to these events. In summary, we find that these events were due to a combination extremely weak upper ocean stratification, facilitated by anomalous upwelling, and exceptionally strong surface winds (see [wintertime ice-ocean feedbacks]({{< ref "project/ice-ocean-feedbacks/index.md" >}}) ). These factors led to the complete erosion of the main pycnocline and convection that extended deep into the ocean interior. The atmospheric conditions that led to the preconditioning of the water column and uptick in storm activity, were linked to decadal variations in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).
