While in graduate school, I was a science communication fellow at the [Seattle Pacific Science Center](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/planetarium/). Through this program, I participated in a science communication training course and designed a planetarium show that showcases fieldwork in the Southern Ocean.

In 2016, I participated in the six-week long I08S GO SHIP cruise. In coordination with the [SOCCOM project](https://soccom.princeton.edu/), I maintained a regular [blog](http://floatdispenser.blogspot.com/2016/03/a-day-in-life-of-ctd-watch-part-33.html) and took questions from a class of six graders at Lakeside Middle School in Seattle.
