I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering at Caltech, working in the [Oceans & Cryosphere, Theory & Observations Group](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/). I completed my PhD at the University of Washington, School of Oceanography, where I was advised by Professor Stephen Riser.

I am interested in the dynamics of the ocean, their coupling with the cryosphere, and the diverse ways in which these processes combine to influence our global climate. My recent work has been focused on the Southern Ocean, an area of interest that has led me to explore the feedbacks between Antarctic sea ice growth and the ventilation of heat from the deep ocean, the dynamics of subpolar gyres and their interactions with seafloor topography, and the drivers of abrupt summertime surface warming events otherwise known as marine heatwaves. To investigate these problems I use a broad array of observations and numerical tools, ranging from in situ measurements to ocean general circulation models.

Update: In summer 2022, I will join Stanford as an assistant professor in the Department of Earth System Science (see new website: https://polar.stanford.edu/). If you are interested in working with me as a graduate student or postdoc, please contact me directly.
