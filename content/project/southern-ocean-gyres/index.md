The Southern Ocean is arguably the central cog in the global ocean overturning circulation. In addition to connecting all the major ocean basins, the Southern Ocean facilitates the upwelling of deep, carbon-rich waters that have been isolated from the atmosphere for centuriesâ€“--sometimes millennia. Moreover, the region is the source of the dense bottom water that cover most of the global seafloor. While most of the deep water upwelling occurs within Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which mostly exists within the latitude band of the Drake Passage, bottom water is almost exclusively produced in select locations along the continental margins of Antarctica. In between these regions of deep water upwelling and bottom water formation lies the **subpolar gyres**---the most prominent of which are the Ross and Weddell Gyres.

<!-- transport and modification of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) is a key component of the global ocean overturning circulation. CDW is primarily found within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and is a mixture of deep waters from all adjacent ocean basins. Under the influence of strong westerly winds and the Earth's rotation, this deep water flows upward towards the surface and subsequently splits into two branches: a northward branch, which eventually replenishes the deep waters formed in the northern Atlantic, and a southward branch that contributes to the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water. This work is mainly concerned with the southward branch that transports relatively warm CDW to the continental slope of Antarctica.-->

Circles with dots indicate eastward flow (out of the screen) while circles with crosses indicate westward flow (into the screen). Squiggly arrows denote heat fluxes. Straighter arrows indicate the mean flow of selected water masses: Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW), Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). In the gyre region, the tau symbol represents the wind stress curl.</figcaption>

Though many studies have examined the subpolar gyres in isolation, we still lack a firm understanding of their the mechanisms that control their circulation and stratification. For example, it is not abundantly clear why the Weddell Gyre is much larger and more weakly stratified than the Ross Gyre. Perhaps more importantly, we still have a poor understanding of how these interact with the ACC and overturning circulation of the Southern Ocean. 

This project aims to address these gaps in our understanding. Our main approach will be to carryout a series of idealized numerical simulations that reduce these gyres to their fundamental dynamics. In doing so, we hope to isolate the impact of these gyres on the greater Southern Ocean circulation. 

<!--, we aim to conduct a series of process-based modeling studies to elucidate the key processes that control the modification of CDW across these gyres. In doing so, we seek to address the following questions:

* What is the relative importance of wind-driven upwelling, isopycnal eddy stirring and surface buoyancy fluxes in setting the shape and depth of isopycnals across these gyres? 
* How does poleward heat transport across these gyres respond to changes in surface heat, freshwater or momentum fluxes? 
* How do the asymmetries in the size and stratification of the Ross and Weddell gyres impact the overturning circulation of the Southern Ocean?-->

<!--### Assessing the potential importance of polar gyre asymmetry in the Southern Ocean overturning

In addition to providing a pathway for deep ocean heat transport to the Antarctic margin, the polar gyres of the Southern Ocean also play an important role in the upwelling of CDW and its transformation into either intermediate or abyssal. In this capacity, these gyres are crucial cogs in the overturning circulation of the Southern Ocean. A key aspect of these gyres is their tendency to flatten isopycnals within the ocean interior (Figure 2). However, this detail is often neglected in the canonical zonally-averaged view of the Southern Ocean residual overturning circulation, which typically assumes isopycnal slopes are uniform with latitude. Furthermore, the current overturning framework also neglects inter-basin asymmetries in ocean stratification. Poleward of the circumpolar current, isopycnal depths can differ by hundreds of meters at a given latitude, with the Weddell Sea having much shallower isopycnals than the Ross Sea. Thus, the pathways of upwelled CDW differ substantially across the Ross and Weddell Seas. 

Since that water masses created within these gyres are exported globally, these regional asymmetries in stratification may have far-reaching effects on the overturning circulation of the global ocean. As before, we aim to diagnose the importance of the gyre asymmetries by using a suite of idealized models, ranging from simple box models to more complex general circulation models.-->
